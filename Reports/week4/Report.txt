Adithya Ravichandran:

- Continued implementation of Provide Dialog along with Levente Ludanyi.
- Finished MetricsTable class to visualise metrics about each and every pool.


Matheo Le Masson:

- This week I coded an error message informing the user that he has entered an invalid input (a word/letter and not a number) for the price of the token, the amount of token to provide, and the amount to mint to an account.
- We switched from qml to qwidget so I had to familiarize myself with this new language to code the message and understand new interface


Amine Roudani:

- Worked further on the implementation of Curve using whitepapers. This involved analyzing and understanding the math behind it, as well as developing the various functions in the class. Also worked on developing tests for curve and V3. 


Minh Pham:

- Create the trade UI (still wait for the backend update to choose protocol.
- Research about the market simulator of Hash.ai for the next stage of development.


Duc Nguyen:
- Help the team member debug the implementation of UniSwapV3 and Balancer
- Assign the implementation of Curve protocol


Victoire FABIEN:

- This week, we started to have a clearer idea of the front end initial result (initial interface). 
- I implemented an additional window to display the graphs, which is accessible through a push button on the main window. 
- I added a graph on the window to get an idea of the final product.  The graph is an example of a constant product with a point labelled.
- It will then be modified and adapted to the data we get from the functions coded.
- During week 5, we should have a working version of the project and I will thus work on perfecting the front end, 
by working on the graphs representing the different protocols and customizing the interface created.


MARTINA PAEZ BERRU:

- This week there was an error with the duplication of the branches and comitting, but I will work on imporving the layout and obtaining the images of the already existing coins. 
- I will continue adding more details to the layout and commenting on the code to explain the functions.
