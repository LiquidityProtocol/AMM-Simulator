Amine Roudani
- Developed test file with various tests for UniswapV3
- Developed a chart to represent divergent loss with respect to time.

Adithya Ravichandran
- Alongside Ludanyi Levente, completed the tokengraph code to graph curve for every protocol
- Refactored introductory window

Mathéo Le Masson
- Find bug : program crashes when user tries to withdraw while being unable to
- Started with Tu to create a graph showing the evolution of the wallet of each account (new GetMarketsbyAccounts function and Create new class AccountGraphItem)

Duc Nguyen
- Developing different strategies of Arbitrager
- Adding view method of the market in time steps

Mia Chambat
-This week I joined the Front End team to help them work on the dynamic styling of the introductory and main windows.
 I’ve become comfortable and familiar with style sheets/forms on c++, and am going to continue working on the visual appearance of our project next week as well.

Shubh Lashkery
- I further refined the simulation as a model that incorporates Black Swan events
- It also is backward looking, and derives expectations from the past
- I added a simulation function to the Playground calss so it can be easily implemented in the Front-end

Minh Pham:
- Create the automatic market simulation playground
- Create inventory graph display
- Fix simulation class on Simulation-utils

The Nguyen:
- Fix and refactor back-end and Playground
- Review, fix, and validate pull requests

Jasmine Samson:
- Worked on the design of the introductory window to make it more coherent with the rest of the project 
- Created a second tab to the introductory window (with Guidelines and a Disclaimer) 
- I tried to implement a frame containing a picture to appear on the window but I still need to find a way to make it work for the members of the group when running the project


Victoire Fabien:
This week I focused on the introductory window. I worked on the “Introductory Window” Branch (now “Introductory Window 2”).
I focused mainly on the layout of the elements of the window by rearranging them to make it more aesthetically pleasing. I made some modification in text alignment. I fixed the “Go to playground” button.


Martina Paez Berru:
This week was the most work done, I editted the introductory branch and changed the main window's bachground colors, buttons, changed bored colors. 
I wrote the texts for the introductory window that describes the liquidity protocol and is a guide to the user. 

Julien:

This week I have furthered my knowledge related to divergence loss.
Then I have implemented different methods other than the absolute value divergence.
The strategy relies on mathematical formulas that measure divergences between
distributions
